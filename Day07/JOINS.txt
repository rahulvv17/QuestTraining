JOINS

- Joins in SQL are used to combine records from two or more tables based on related columns. 

## TYPES OF JOINS

1.INNER JOIN: 
- Returns records that have matching values in both tables.                                                                       
    SELECT columns FROM table1
    INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
                                                                                                                                                                                     
2.LEFT JOIN: 
- Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. 
- If no match, NULL values are returned.
    SELECT columns FROM table1                                                                                                                                      
    LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;           

3.RIGHT JOIN: 
- Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. 
- If no match, NULL values are returned. 
    SELECT columns FROM table1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
                                                                                                                                                                                     
4.FULL JOIN:  
- Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table records. 
- If there is no match, NULL values are returned.
    SELECT columns FROM table1
    FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
