TYPES OF QUERIES

1. Data Definition Language (DDL)
   - Use: DDL is used to define, modify, and delete database structures.
   - DDL Commands:
     1. CREATE: Used to create a new table or database.
          CREATE TABLE students (
              id INT PRIMARY KEY,
              name VARCHAR(50),
              age INT
          );

     2. ALTER: Used to modify an existing database structure.
          ALTER TABLE students ADD email VARCHAR(100);

     3. DROP: Used to delete tables or databases.
          DROP TABLE students;

     4. TRUNCATE: Used to delete all rows from a table without logging the individual row deletions.
          TRUNCATE TABLE students;

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
   - Use: DML is used for managing and manipulating data in databases.
   - DML Commands:
     1. SELECT: Used to retrieve data from a database.
          SELECT * FROM students;

     2. INSERT: Used to add new data into a database.
          INSERT INTO students (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 20);

     3. UPDATE: Used to modify existing data.
          UPDATE students SET age = 21 WHERE id = 1;

     4. DELETE: Used to remove data from a database.
          DELETE FROM students WHERE id = 1;

3. Data Control Language (DCL)
   - Use: DCL is used to control access to data in the database.
   - DCL Commands:
     1. GRANT: Gives user access privileges to the database.
          GRANT SELECT ON students TO user1;

     2. REVOKE: Takes back user access privileges.
          REVOKE INSERT ON students FROM user1;

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL)
   - Use: TCL is used to manage transactions in a database.      
   - TCL Commands:
     1.COMMIT: Saves all the changes made in the current transaction.
          COMMIT;

     2.ROLLBACK: Undoes changes made in the current transaction if an error occurs.
          ROLLBACK;

     3.SAVEPOINT: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back.
          SAVEPOINT savepoint_name;

     4.SET TRANSACTION: Configures the properties of the current transaction.
          SET TRANSACTION [READ ONLY | READ WRITE];


5. Data Query Language (DQL) 
   - Use: Used primarily for querying and retrieving data from a database. 
   - It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language).
   - DQL Commands:
     1.SELECT : Used to select columns from one or more tables.
          SELECT column1_name, column2_name FROM table_name;

     2.FROM : Specifies the table from which to retrieve the data.
          SELECT column1_name, column2_name FROM table_name;

     3.WHERE : A clause used to filter records based on specified conditions.
          SELECT * FROM Employees
          WHERE Department = 'Sales';
          This query selects all columns from the Employees table where the Department is 'Sales'.

     4.ORDER BY: Used to sort the result set in ascending or descending order.
          SELECT * FROM Employees
          ORDER BY Salary DESC;
          This query selects all columns from the Employees table and sorts the result set by the Salary column in descending order.

     5.GROUP BY : Used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
          SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
          FROM table_name
          GROUP BY column1;

     6.HAVING : A clause used to filter groups based on conditions, often used with aggregate functions.
          SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
          FROM table_name
          GROUP BY column1
          HAVING condition;


SOME OTHER COMMON QUERIES

1. AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
- Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. 
- Common aggregate functions include SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

    1. SUM:
        SELECT SUM(Salary) FROM Employees;
        This returns the total sum of the Salary column in the Employees table.

    2. COUNT:
        SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employees;
        This returns the total number of rows in the Employees table.

    3. AVG:
        SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees;
        This returns the average salary from the Employees table.

    4. MIN:
        SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employees;
        This returns the minimum value in the Salary column from the Employees table.

    5. MAX:
        SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees;
        This returns the maximum value in the Salary column from the Employees table.

2. DISTINCT
- The DISTINCT keyword is used in SQL to return only distinct (unique) values within a column. 
- It eliminates duplicate values from the result set.
    SELECT DISTINCT Department FROM Employees;
    This query selects unique department names from the Employees table, removing any duplicate values.

3. CREATE INDEX
- CREATE INDEX is used to speed up the retrieval of data from a database table. 
- Indexes can be created on one or more columns of a table.
    CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON Employees(Salary);
    This creates an index named idx_salary on the Salary column of the Employees table. This can make queries that search or sort by Salary much faster.
