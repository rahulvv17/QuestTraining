 VIEWS

- A view is a virtual table in SQL that is based on the result of a SELECT query. 
- It does not store data physically but provides a way to present data from one or more tables.

USE

- Views are used to:
  - Simplify complex queries.
  - Provide a layer of security by restricting access to specific rows or columns.
  - Present data in a specific format or structure.

 CREATING A VIEW

  CREATE VIEW student_view AS
  SELECT first_name, last_name, age
  FROM students
  WHERE age >= 18;

- Once a view is created, you can use it in SELECT statements just like a regular table.
    SELECT * FROM student_view;

 UPDATING A VIEW

- Some views can be updated if they meet certain conditions.
    UPDATE student_view SET age = 21 WHERE first_name = 'John';

DROPPING A VIEW

- To remove a view, use the DROP VIEW statement:
    DROP VIEW view_name;

ADVANTAGES OF VIEWS

- Simplicity: Simplifies complex SQL queries by encapsulating them in a view.
- Security: Allows users to access specific data without exposing the entire table.
- Reusability: Views can be reused in multiple queries.

DISADVANTAGES OF VIEWS

- Performance: Views can lead to performance issues if they are complex or if they involve many joins.
- Limited Functionality: Not all views are updatable, and some operations may be restricted.
