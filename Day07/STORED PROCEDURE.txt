STORED PROCEDURE

Definition: A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be called by applications or users.



Creating a Stored Procedure

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeById
@EmployeeId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Employees
    WHERE Id = @EmployeeId;
END;


Executing the Stored Procedure

EXEC GetEmployeeById @EmployeeId = 1;


Advantages of Stored Procedures
Performance:

Stored procedures are precompiled, improving performance compared to executing multiple individual SQL statements.
Reusability:

Can be reused across different applications without rewriting SQL code.
Security:

Allows users to execute procedures without direct access to underlying data, enhancing security.
Maintainability:

Business logic changes can be made in the stored procedure without modifying the application code.
Transaction Management:

Stored procedures can manage transactions, ensuring data integrity.
