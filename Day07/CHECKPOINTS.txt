## CHECKPOINTS

- A checkpoint is a mechanism in database management systems that saves the current state of the database to persistent storage. 
- It acts as a synchronization point to ensure data consistency and durability.

## PURPOSE OF CHECKPOINTS

    1.Data Recovery
    2.Performance Improvement
    3.Transaction Management

## TYPES OF CHECKPOINTS

    1.Automatic Checkpoints:
    - Automatically triggered by the DBMS based on specific criteria (e.g., time intervals or log file sizes).

    2.Manual Checkpoints:
    - Initiated by database administrators or users using specific commands, allowing for greater control over when the checkpoint occurs.

    3.Incremental Checkpoints:
    - Only the changes made since the last checkpoint are recorded, reducing the amount of data that needs to be written to disk.

    4.Full Checkpoints:
    - A complete snapshot of the database is taken, which can require more time and resources than incremental checkpoints.


## IMPORTANCE OF CHECKPOINTS

    1.Ensures Data Integrity: 
    - Checkpoints help maintain a consistent database state, ensuring that data is reliable and can be trusted after recovery.
    
    2.Reduces Recovery Time: 
    - In the event of a crash, checkpoints allow the system to recover more quickly by reducing the amount of transaction log data that must be processed.
    
    3.Facilitates Concurrency Control: 
    - Checkpoints help manage concurrent transactions, ensuring that changes made by one transaction do not affect others inappropriately.
