You are working on a database for a schoolâ€™s student management system. The system contains a table named courses that stores information about the courses offered at the school and the students enrolled in them.
 
You have been tasked to generate a report that shows the following information for each course:
1. The total number of students enrolled.
2. The total fees collected for each course.
3. The course with the maximum number of enrollments.

- Write SQL queries to accomplish the following tasks:
1-Find the total number of students enrolled in each course:
The result should display the course_name and the total count of students enrolled in that course.
2-- Calculate the total fees collected for each course:
The result should display the course_name and the sum of the course_fee collected.
3-- Determine the course with the maximum number of enrollments:
Display the course_name and the number of students enrolled for the course with the highest enrollment

CREATE TABLE courses(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY  IDENTITY,
  student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  course_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  fees INT NOT NULL
  )

  INSERT INTO courses(student_name,course_name,fees) VALUES
  ('name1','course1',1000),
  ('name2','course2',2000),
  ('name3','course1',1000),
  ('name4','course2',2000),
  ('name5','course1',1000)

  1- SELECT COUNT(id) AS total_students,course_name FROM courses GROUP BY course_name
  2-  SELECT course_name,SUM(fees) AS total_fees FROM courses GROUP BY course_name
  3- SELECT TOP 1 course_name,COUNT(id) AS no_of_students_enrolled FROM courses GROUP BY course_name ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC
